## 🛡️ 4. Security Features

### Protected Routes:
```typescript
/admin → Requires authentication
/login → Public access
```

### Authentication Flow:
1. User visits `/admin`
2. If not logged in → Redirected to `/login`
3. After successful login → Redirected to `/admin`
4. Logout → Cleared session + Redirect to `/login`

### Session Management:
- Token stored in `localStorage`
- Auto-validation on page load
- Expires when user logs out
